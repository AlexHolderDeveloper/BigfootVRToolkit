# BigfootVRToolkit
A quickstart beginner-targeted VR toolkit for Unity, based on Unity's built-in generic VR capabilities. It's either this or you start using a dozen different SDKs if you're doing multiplatform VR, basically.

Built in Unity 2017.2.0p2. Compatible with that version and newer. YMMV on older Unity 2017 versions. 
This will definitely NOT work on versions prior to Unity 2017.
